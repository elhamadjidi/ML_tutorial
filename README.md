# ML_tutorial
Welcome to our interactive machine learning project, where you can explore fundamental concepts in machine learning (ML) and learn how to code and run them yourself!

To execute the code, you have two options: either download the IPython file and upload it to your preferred IDE or simply click the "Open in Colab" button to view and run the file in the Google Colab environment.
